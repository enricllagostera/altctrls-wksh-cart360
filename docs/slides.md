# WHY?

---
class: middle

### A short list

1. Things as invitations for playfulness.
2. We can learn to play all over again.
3. Unexpected materiality as a basis for performance.
4. We are embodied players with different bodies and bodily cultures.

---
class: middle

### My reasons

- The need to problematize **innovative game design** discourses.
- Brecht & alienation effects: point to **systemic forces**.
- Algava, Boal & forum theatre: **play & situated dialogue**.
- Relationship with craft, industry and DIY culture: **circulation & practices**.
- Invitations, **encounters**, transitions (in-out).

---
class: middle

## Alternative controllers help to re-situate and transform play, pointing to different systemic issues and practices.

---
class: middle

## Cook Your Way

- Speculative controller as **embodiment** of a (not-that-)fictional gameworld.
- **Critique** of capitalist discourses of multiculturalism and oppressive immigration systems.
- **Contradictions** as invitations to reflection: visuals and text.
- **Modding** and circulation.

# HOW?

---
class: middle

### Some approaches

1. Re-appropriated device + extension + HID + existing game (gambi_abo)
2. Custom device + serial + custom game (Cook Your Way)
3. Custom device + HID + existing game (what we'll be making)

### Design moves in .hi[gambi_abo]

- Identify inputs recognized by the game;
- Analyze the possible inputs from the device at hand;
- Imagine verbs for the different inputs (in-game and in-device);
- Extend scales of movement;

### Clappy Bird

**Situation:** Flap wings (_in-game effect, instantaneous_) -> Sensed as space key press or mouse down (_game application expects a mouse or keyboard via HID_) -> Finger movement to activate a button (_world change_).

### Clappy Bird

<https://flappybird.io/>

**Situation:** Flap wings (_in-game effect, instantaneous_) -> Sensed as space key press or mouse down (_game application expects a mouse or keyboard via HID_) -> Finger movement to activate a button (_world change_).

**Changes:** Clap hands / make noise (_world change, instantaneous_) -> Sensed as loudness change (_sensor state goes over a defined threshold on data_) -> Sent to _game application_ as space key press (_over a simulated HID keyboard_).

### Simulating a [keyboard](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/)

```c
#include <Keyboard.h> // library to simulate keyboard events

int sensorPin = A0 ;  // define sensor port (analog A0)
int value = 0;    //set value to 0
int threshold = 320; // threshold for data range

void setup()
{
  Keyboard.begin();
}

void loop()
{
  value = analogRead(sensorPin);
  if(value > threshold){
    Keyboard.press(' ');
  }
  else {
    Keyboard.releaseAll();
  }
  delay(10);  //delay 0.01S
}
```

## So many sensors!

## Modding [Veloce](https://torfi.itch.io/veloce)

- How are in-game effects codified by the game application?
- What data ranges are expected? 
- What sensors could work for this?
- What world changes could be interesting for these in-game effects?

### Simulating a [mouse](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/mouse/)

- Using an accelerometer for X and Y movement;
- [Example code for the ADXL337 accelerometer](https://github.com/sparkfun/ADXL337_Breakout/blob/master/firmware/ADXL337_example/ADXL337_example.ino);

---
Simulating a mouse with an accelerometer (1/2)

```c
#include <Mouse.h>
int scale = 3;
float mouseSpeed = 20.0;

void setup()
{
  Mouse.begin();
}

void loop()
{
  // Get raw accelerometer data for each axis
  int rawX = analogRead(A0);
  int rawY = analogRead(A1);
  int rawZ = analogRead(A2);
  
  float scaledX, scaledY, scaledZ; // Scaled values for each axis
  scaledX = mapf(rawX, 0, 675, -scale, scale); // 3.3/5 * 1023 =~ 675
  scaledY = mapf(rawY, 0, 675, -scale, scale);
  scaledZ = mapf(rawZ, 0, 675, -scale, scale);
  
  delay(10);

  Mouse.move(scaledZ * mouseSpeed, -scaledY * mouseSpeed, 0);
}
```

---
Simulating a mouse with an accelerometer (2/2)

```c
// Same functionality as Arduino's standard map function, except using floats
float mapf(float x, float in_min, float in_max, float out_min, float out_max)
{
  return (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
}
```
